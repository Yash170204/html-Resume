I have lived and grew up in a household filled with a CEO and a teacher so I have a good idea what is expected of me in a Company.I have utmost respect for everyone around me and I work on a philosophy of trusting everyone until they break the trust and I dont think that is taking me too far but i still like to think that I can trust people.</p>
